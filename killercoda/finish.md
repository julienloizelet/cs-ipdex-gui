# Setting Up Environment

The environment is being prepared. This takes **2-3 minutes**.

Watch the terminal for progress. When you see **"READY"**, open the GUI:

**[Open IPdex GUI]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}})**

## Using the GUI

1. Enter your CrowdSec CTI API key
2. Enter IP addresses (one per line)
3. Click **Query IPs** to see threat intelligence

## Troubleshooting

```bash
cat /var/log/setup.log      # Setup logs
cat /var/log/ipdex-gui.log  # GUI logs
```
